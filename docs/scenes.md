# Scenes
This repo includes a few scenes that are free for you to use for any purpose.  Our demo figures and paper use some scenes (primarily textures and meshes) that were purchased and cannot be re-distributed here but we have included links to where you can obtain them.  For the purchased scenes, we have included the Mitsuba scene files (xml structure) in this repo so that you can easily reproduce our results once you download the assets.  

If you wish to use a scene that is not in Mitsuba format, we recommend that you download and install the free 3D tool [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), and download a scene as a `.blend` file.  To use them with the Mitsuba differentiable renderer, you may convert them using this tool [Mitsuba-Blender](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba-blender)
